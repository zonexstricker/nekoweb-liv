                <h1>Welcome to my Team Fortress 2 Page</h1>
                <p>I started playing TF2 on my PC on the 7th of July, 2013. Which is the exact day I made my steam account. I've met a lot of people who made their steam account just to play TF2, it was my big gateway into online PC games, especially since it was free to play.</p>
                <p>Some of my most formative experience as a young child were spent on dustbowl, 2fort, gravel pit and steel. Along with a lot of hours spent on saxton hale and freak fortress.</p>
                <p>If I spent all the time I spent on achievement and idle maps on something more productive, I would probably be in a good unviersity right now studying something important. Instead I'm talking about TF2, and I'm not even sure I am upset about that.</p>

                <p>I had the orange-box on my XBOX 360 as a kid, at the time I did play the XBOX version of TF2, if anyone else has also experienced the PS3 and XBOX 360 version of TF2 they will understand how rough that old version is. People running around in glitched taunts and the constant lag somehow didn't take away from my enjoyment, but I always yearned to play the PC version.</p>
                <p>Sometime between the overlap of having an XBOX 360 and having a PC I would play both, but usually I could only play one version between broken PCs and when I ditched the dinky XBOX for my magically-now-working PC.</p>

                <p>Nowadays I mainly play Team Fortress 2 Classic, which is a fan mod based of the initial release on the game with a few scrapped features re-implemented. The most popular of the changes being the re-introduction of the Civilian. I am not a fan of the VIP mode, which the Civilian stars in, this is because I think it is a worse version of capture the flag or payload. However I do enjoy having a character to choose when I want to shut my brain off and hit people with a brolly or cane. I much prefer the older versions at the moment, but I usually flip between playing "live" TF2 and TF2C.</p>

            <div class="box">
                <p>The game is available for free on Steam, although I reccomend paying for the cheapest item in the Mann Co.
                    Store so you can have premium features!</p>
                <p>I have also linked mastercom's config app, this can heavily improve performance on older PCs and can get
                    you more stable framerates.</p>
