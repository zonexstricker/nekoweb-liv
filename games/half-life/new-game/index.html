    <p>I first played the orignal half life in 2019 when it was on a sale. I enjoyed it but only because I had played Half-Life 2 previously.</p>
    <p>At the time I didn't really apreciate the massive innovations it made to the first person shooter genre, essentially rocket jumping story-driven FPS into the mainstream for gamers.</p>
    <p>Playing it now and taking time to appreciate what it brought to the table is a fantastic experience. I never played it all the way through my first time, which I regret. I would've appreciated it beyond its novelty of being the game before HL2.</p>
    <p>I first played Half-Life 2 on the XBOX 360 Orange Box port. It ran very well on the console, but as a kid a lot of the physics puzzles and story went over my head.</p>
    <p>Half-Life as a series is something I hold very dearly. If it wasn't for Half-Life half the games I have ever played just would not exist. Not to mention the knock-on effect Half-Life had on the FPS genre, games many people tout as the best games ever are story-driven FPS games.</p>
    <p>I played through Half-Life 2 to it's completion in 2019 after I had tried out Half-Life 1. It was fantastic, to this day I cannot believe how a game from 2004 can outclass games made 8 years later in graphics, story, physics engine and gameplay. It is truly a masterpiece of a game, and should be in every FPS players game library.</p>
    <p>I also played through Half-Life Alyx in 2019 - as you can see I had quite the hyperfixation at the time - and I have yet to this day found a better VR game. It's worth even buying an index and only using it for HL:A.</p>
